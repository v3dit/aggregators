Love & Latte is honest & professional to send me good pizza with 100% cheese and well made after not being specialized in pizza alone. 1 star less because it was 7 inch only instead of 8 inch and that is not a disaster, but than it becomes overpriced. Best pizza in Mumbai @Joe's Pizza makes full 8 inch much more loaded at 230rs only, so less loaded smaller at higher price will be a natural deterrent for return customers.","322":"Amazing food","323":"Amazing place!!","324":"food was amazing l","325":"They\u2019ve got amazing food, and the ambience is just truly incredible!!","326":"the Cafe is damn aesthetic and loved the vibe n coffee ","327":"Amazing place with delicious food and oleasant ambience","328":"great food and excellent ambiance!","329":"Good food and experience!!

A complete acidic taste of my tongue gave this a feeling of it being really stale and disgusting. The similar taste I got with THE CHOCOLATE PYRAMID which was equally bad.

They have outside and inside seating. u003cbr\/>u003cbr\/>I had Veg Supreme Pizza which was really good. Soft with lots of veggies. Had Chamomile and Jasmin Pearls Tea. They have Zomato Gold 1+1 on food and I got warm gooey chocolate walnut brownie with vanilla ice cream for free. It was gooey and not too sweet. Perfect balance for anyone who does have check on diet.","390":"The place has a good ambience with all the cute stuff. A very polite and helpful staff.

Although it\u2019s a hassle to find the place since google location is wrong, I still managed to reach the place thanks to help from a friend. It\u2019s located at AB Nair Road ahead of ISKCON temple. The place is very pretty and the seating outside is really cute. The seating inside is also nice but the tables are too small to have more than one dish at a time. The best part is they are on zomato gold on food so it doesn\u2019t burn a hole in your pocket. Here\u2019s what I tried: u003cbr\/>Drinks: u003cbr\/>1. Red Velvet Divine with vanilla Icecream (5\/5)- FAVOURITE Shake from now! Super sweet and high in calories but so so tasty I truly enjoyed it. Highly recommended u003cbr\/>2. Nutella Hot Chocolate (5\/5)- Super tasty! Truly loved the consistency and flavour which was so mild and not overpowering. It\u2019s great to accompany a good read. Must tryu003cbr\/>3. Elderflower Iced Tea (4.5\/5)- I loved it. Anyone who likes the flavour will enjoy this. Unique and tasty u003cbr\/>4. Green Apple Slush (5\/5)- I wish the presentation was better but the taste was mind blowing. Definitely one of the best slush I\u2019ve had in recent times. Highly recommended u003cbr\/>u003cbr\/>Starters: u003cbr\/>1. Cheesy nachos (3.5\/5)- The cheese sauce is amazing but I was disappointed with them using Dorritos and the price was too high for nachos without  beans. Taste wise only the tortilla could be improved. u003cbr\/>2. L & L Jalape\u00f1o Cheese Sandwich (5\/5)- YUM! They were not stingy with jalape\u00f1os and Chillies and the cheese spread used was also amazing. I really loved this sandwich but presentation could be improved. u003cbr\/>u003cbr\/>Mains: u003cbr\/>1. Peri Peri Paneer Pizza (4\/5)- I liked the looks and taste of fit but didn\u2019t find it to be very spicy. Good quantity of Paneer was there and it was a good main.u003cbr\/>2. House Mac n Cheese (5\/5)- BEST DISH! I was so sad that I called for a small portion of it as I wanted more by the time I finished this lipsmacking preparation. Highly recommended u003cbr\/>u003cbr\/>Desserts: u003cbr\/>1. Cheesecake (2\/5)- Really was not fresh and tasted like the cheese had gone bad as the texture was also rubbery and the jam didn\u2019t taste fresh either. Maybe a bad day. u003cbr\/>u003cbr\/>2. Chocolate Ganache with Vanilla ice cream (4\/5)- Loved this one as it was like molten lava cake which was really moist and I enjoyed it a lot but the name had ganache which was absent, hence 4\/5. Must try u003cbr\/>u003cbr\/>Overall it\u2019s a great place and service was good too. Must visit atleast once. All their drinks were superb. Thanks to Komal for her service and recommendations.","396":"A nice and quaint cafe in the bylanes of Juhu. Open till wee hours the place offers a great variety of coffee and light meals. I recommend dark hot chocolate, Mint Mocha to drink, cummin spiced cottage cheese panini for spice lovers& chocolate ganache for the bitter choc lovers. The hummus tasted light and delicious however the portion size is way to small. Mexicana sandwich was little bland and dry to chew.u003cbr\/>u003cbr\/>Overall, very good place to catch up with pals . Also, the staff is very friendly and thoughtful.u003cbr\/>u003cbr\/>","397":"The croissant had a good taste and good filling but they burnt the side in toasting it which I do not appreciate.","398":"Ambience is cosy. Service is nice. Tried the following items:u003cbr\/>Chicken wrap - 2\/5u003cbr\/>Chicken pizza - 2\/5u003cbr\/>Nutella hot chocolate - 4\/5u003cbr\/>Caramel Frappe - 3.5\/5u003cbr\/>Chocolate ganache pastry - 5\/5u003cbr\/>Blueberry cheesecake - 3.5\/5u003cbr\/>Tiramisu mousse - 4\/5","399":"Okayish","400":"Great food, amazing ambience.","401":"Plz initiate refund.

It is a very beautiful place. The lighting here is very cool and the ambience are also good. The are very friendly but the food quality is not that good. The shake and pastries are quite good.","406":"Good ambience but not a great menu. The quality of ingredients is very average. Coffee isn\u2019t bursting with flavour as it should. It\u2019s easy to source cheap South Indian filter coffees which are bursting with aroma. Didn\u2019t enjoy their coffee and the whole cafe has a terrible smell of bad quality refined oil. Makes one want to not visit it again. Please switch to a better quality oil and install an exhaust. Otherwise it will drive people away. Have to come home and wash my hair and clothes or else they keep smelling of the terrible oil frying smell. Good effort small changes can take the cafe to the next level.

The ambience is superb but when it comes to food they need to improve a lot as they have few options like mostly sandwiches, wraps and pizza but the food was served without any presentation. Downstairs they have amazing board games to play. So it's a fun place to hangout and they have amazing drinks...","412":"Love & Latte Have opened their new branch in Juhu , near Isckon Templeu003cbr\/>It is a very beautiful and pleasing place .u003cbr\/>The Lighting here are very cute and the ambience is also well made .u003cbr\/>The staff is also very friendly.u003cbr\/>But about the food they need to improve a bit more and add some more thrilling dishes in their menu especially some sandwiches and pizzasu003cbr\/>But the Shakes & Pastries offered here are fabulous and enough to make this place worth visiting ","413":"The place is nice and pleasant to the eye.. you will like being there more than you like the desserts. They were average. The cheesecake felt heavy and chocolate pyramid did not live up to the description. You can do better on the dessert front. u003cbr\/>Staff was very welcoming.","414":"Food - The food taste was average. We ordered a pizza (not any extraordinary), pasta (they charged Rs 50 extra just for pink sauce but it taste good), beans and pepper nachos (I would rather suggest u just buy packed nacho chips and cheese sauce, there was very little beans to even call it nachos with beans).u003cbr\/>Beverages - We ordered red velvet shake which was really good. And watermelon mojito which was quite refreshing.u003cbr\/>The ambience is pretty cool. Good place to hangout with friends","415":"love and latte opened doors in Juhu and our excitement for new cafes opening close to home got us here. while a small portion of it is till in scaffolding and stuff, the indoor seating is open and what wonderful vibes and what good music!u003cbr\/>u003cbr\/>we started off our meal with some super delicious beverages. the kit Kat shake was the bomb and the Nutella hot chocolate was just right, not very sweet, not very bitter, just the way I like it!u003cbr\/>The food followed and we had the home style Mac and cheese which was a major disappointment and truly put us off! on an after thought, the peri peri paneer pizza was really good and maybe just because we were really upset after the Mac and cheese incident, we didn't enjoy it much. the number of paneer pieces was really good for the size of the pizza and it also was well spiced! we also had the nachos which were regular, nothing super special! my younger sister Soumyaa only ate the nachos and cleaned off the plate, what also made the nachos a little different was they used a house sauce and not the ready made yellow sauces!","416":"Reading the reviews, was very keen on trying this place out...but was quite disappointed with the food and service.u003cbr\/>First the seating looks attractive but not very comfortable. They have indoor as well as outdoor section. indoor the lighting is too bright and outdoor they don't have fans.u003cbr\/>Based on all the praises in the other reviews we ordered the nachos (2\/5)but was highly disappointed...it was just Doritos with cheese sauce and 2 thin strands of red bell pepper..overall porionsize was also quite small. When we asked for some salsa sauce they dint have it nor did they give any other options so then we asked for some Tabasco.u003cbr\/>Next we ordered the red velvet shake (3.5\/5) I quite liked it but others dint...it's quite heavy though..so be careful while orderingu003cbr\/>Last we ordered the waffle with extra toppings of cream and chocolate icecream...nothing bad but u get better ones nearby at tea villa (3.5\/5)u003cbr\/>u003cbr\/>Worst part we used Zomato gold...the waiter took our no. Before taking the order...however the bill did not account for it...when we complained is when they gave us a new bill.u003cbr\/>u003cbr\/>Overall it is not a place u must try but it's ok if it around and want to go for some desserts to new place...not very pricey and they play good music.","417":"The delivery was delayed so much that we were late for the office. When called i was told that the system was not working so the food wasn't prepared. In that case how the order was accepted. There was no information of delay for a long time otherwise I would have ordered from somewhere else. And the portion size of the tikka sandwich was small compared to other places","418":"The food was good, but the coffee was terrible and super overpriced, even the service staff was less than bothered to attend the customers.","419":"odd taste slushie","420":"The oatmeal cookie was too dry. It is more like a biscuit rather than a cookie. Very disappointed in the quality!","421":"The ambience was fine but the tables were very unstable and not proportional to the chair which made it difficult to sit.

Next we ordered the veg quesadilla- it was warm but the filling inside had what I really don\u2019t know. u003cbr\/>The lemon Mojito was probably the only thing that was worth drinking. A cheese cake we ordered was also not that great. u003cbr\/>I really don\u2019t know how so many people have given such good reviews.. maybe we went early morning so the chef was different? u003cbr\/>u003cbr\/>u003cbr\/>I must mention that their basement games section is just too good, just that 100\u20b9 an hour per person is way too much!! u003cbr\/>","430":"I i have to review this place it is in the two category.u003cbr\/>1. How it looks from inside 2. The taste u get in.u003cbr\/>The look from inside is well maintained and logically creative. Good for couples who wants to spend time with playing some decent games. The house is well occupied with the several cards games. Their is a ground+ basement. Ground floor give u a charm look of a typical english coffee shop. The basement is desighed as a game club.u003cbr\/>But if i talk about the food and beaverag the house is just fail to lift up his name. Frapee has a ice and not taste. I orderd chicken pizza the chicken topings was mildly stinky as it was not fresh.then i ordered waffle, they were also like doing out of the world. They were too sogy and the ice cream served with it has no taste.it was like i am having a bread pudding in waffle style.u003cbr\/>Overall the house has to do lots of hardwork on their menu.","431":"I am adding a genuine review considering the amount of sponsored reviews seen here.
