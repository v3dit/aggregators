The staff were all friendly and attentive, and the owner even took the time to come over and personally greet people and thank them for coming in.u003cbr\/>u003cbr\/>The food was absolutely delicious. I ordered a sweet potato starter and it was fresh, flavorful and made with high-quality ingredients. They also had a great selection of smoothies which was also fresh and baked goods, all of which looked amazing.u003cbr\/>u003cbr\/>But what really stood out to me was the exceptional service. Despite the busy lunch rush, the staff remained cheerful, attentive and accommodating to all of their customers. Everyone seemed genuinely happy to be working there, and it showed in the way they treated their customers. The interior of the restaurant too, gives out alot of positive and calm vibes. u003cbr\/>u003cbr\/>Overall, I would recommend this cafe to anyone looking for delicious food and exceptional service. The warm and welcoming atmosphere, combined with the delicious food and friendly staff, make this a must-visit spot for anyone looking for a great dining experience.","32":"Amazingly aesthetic ambience!!

","38":"Nice ambiance overall good","39":"Zomato pay doesn't work here.. pls remove it from the app","40":"Needs a little more salt and zest in the form of lemon probably.","41":"I liked the ambience more than the food at Earth. I Had ordered a sourdough sandwich, the filling was good but the bread was quite dry. Paneer tikka wrap was tasty. Food is a little expensive here compared to the taste they offer. ","42":"ordered a hot chocolate and mocha cappuccino, it was too good! u003cbr\/>great service, amazing ambience! ","43":"We reached here for dinner last night after a movie and I liked the place from the moment we arrived.u003cbr\/>Everything that we ordered on the menu was really good. We ordered two dishes with pesto and it was really fresh.  Our server made good suggestions and we were very happy with everything. And the chocolate hazelnut cake was out of this world, more so to know that it was gluten free and made with jaggery.u003cbr\/>We had a glitch in the bill payment, our mistake, but the staff was patient and kind and waited for us to sort the issue.u003cbr\/>Would love to visit again and try other things on the menu.","44":"very good food. healthy and freshly served. good jain options.

Would totally visit again & recommend others to visit.","47":"My first visit at Earth cafe Juhu was a mix of positive and negatives. u003cbr\/>u003cbr\/>Ambience was good. Music was not loud. Fairly clean but Tables are very close to each other. Staff was attentive. Cappuccino was good.u003cbr\/>u003cbr\/>Avocado bruschetta was okay. Avocado was fresh but the bread was dry and felt stale.   While the sourdough exterior was toasty and hard, the center did not feel fresh or fluffy. Portion size was disappointing for the price. u003cbr\/>u003cbr\/>u003cbr\/>Staff is biased in their treatment towards customers. While they allow some to linger for hours, they ensure that other customers leave ASAP","48":"The tomato basil soup was barely enough for one person and had too much pepper. The quantity can be improved.u003cbr\/>u003cbr\/>The Cubano sandwich had too much pepper and the overall flavour wasn\u2019t balanced.u003cbr\/>u003cbr\/>The Rainbow sandwich was quite nice and flavourful.","49":"Very less mayo","50":"On menu many items are not available at 8pm so be prepared to hear this not available that not available which makes us to take what comes fast to table mayb not really know about it but ya this was my experience","51":"over priced an size of the roll is too small ","52":"There was less salt. And it wasn\u2019t yummy as usual. Something was missing","53":"Didn\u2019t like the taste. The salad was bland. And the wrap was too garlicky.","54":"Unbearable noisy place. It feels like you\u2019re in a fish market. Bad experience.","55":"Quite average and expensive food to be honest. Pizza at 900-1000 bucks is the most average pizza I\u2019ve ever eaten in my life. The pizza base was horrible. The mushroom starters was more oily than any fried food I\u2019ve ever had.Not worth spending 1k per person for dinner at all. Rather go to bombay salad, seeds of life or greenr. This place won\u2019t last in juhu for long ","56":"Improper packing. The hot chocolate was leaked all over the box when we received it.","57":"I have been to the restaurant 2 days ago. The quantity served there is way more than what u are sending for home delivery. The filling was very less and the wrap seemed smaller or leaner I would say. Taste was just the same. But if I am paying the same amount then why this partiality","58":"This is the second time i got spilled hot choco delivered from Earth cafe","59":"I asked for extra sour cream, instead they have not put sour cream at all, i need a refund for this.","60":"I experienced being cheated as the strawberry as shown was not there nor was the chai seeds in the watermelon juice","61":"Spilled packaging, ordered 2 cakes, got both of them spoiled","62":"very bad coffee. only coconut milk taste ","63":"I hope it's not meat because it's just like it to eat","64":"the gravy that is provided is very less. not enough for the rice and tofu and not enough for the price. ","65":"didn't get the nuts and chocolate sauce. ","66":"The food was just bread and avacadoes , no salt no peeper , very lil pesto saucing the bottom , overall poor quality","67":"Very disappointed with the service its like fish market and service was like highway dhaba the person  wearing cap button removed not the hospitality standard . Food was amazing really love it but have to look after the standards.","68":"didn't taste good ","69":"one of the items didn't come and i didn't get a refund ","70":"Raw potato..no seasoning","71":"The staff does not know the policy.. They want to charge 1000 per person and let them sit there and work for 2-3 hours and not beyond that.","72":"I recently had the misfortune of visiting Earth cafe, and I can confidently say that it was one of the most disappointing dining experiences I've ever had. From the exorbitant prices to the lackluster food, this caf\u00e9 failed to deliver on every front.u003cbr\/>Let's start with the pricing. I understand that some establishments charge a premium for quality, but [Caf\u00e9 Name] took it to a whole new level. The menu boasted lofty prices that would lead you to expect a culinary masterpiece, but what I received was far from it. It felt like a slap in the face to pay such exorbitant amounts for what turned out to be subpar dishes.u003cbr\/>Speaking of the food, it was nothing short of disappointing. I ordered their supposedly signature dish, but it arrived looking like a sad, underwhelming imitation of what was described on the menu. The presentation lacked creativity, and the flavors were completely underwhelming. The ingredients seemed cheap, and it felt like the kitchen staff had no passion or skill when it came to preparing the dishes. The food lacked seasoning, tasted bland, and left me craving something more satisfying.u003cbr\/>To make matters worse, the portion sizes were laughably small for the prices charged. I left the caf\u00e9 feeling unsatisfied and had to find an alternative place to appease my hunger. It's mind-boggling that Earth Cafe believes it can get away with serving tiny portions and charging an arm and a leg for them.u003cbr\/>u003cbr\/>All in all, I cannot recommend Earth Cafe to anyone. The combination of sky-high prices, subpar food, and lackluster service make it a complete disappointment. Save your hard-earned money and seek out other dining options where you can truly enjoy your meal without feeling ripped off.","73":"Walnut were smelling something was v wrong","74":"I didn\u2019t get my guac on toast very disappointing","75":"Not a good place to visit. They are confused what they want to be called. If u are a cafe than u cannot stop me working on laptop. Even if that is ur rules for weekend. That you won\u2019t let ppl open there laptop then say it at first place. So I went there sat and opened my laptop to work and then called waiter to take my order. They took my order and they served. But after few minted they came and said ma\u2019am u cannot work here on weekend. So ok. But they saw I was on laptop from very start. They could have asked me to stop then. But no they waited me to order and when I am half way there they asked me to stop working. Worst experience ever. Very expensive food. They just want to make money. Whether customer is happy or not. Very angry.","76":"I had ordered for a tomato basil soup which was extremely spicy, when I told the waiter he said we will give you another one, they literally got me the same soup with sugar in it, the waiter didn't even care when he was given this feedback. We called for the cheque and left. ","77":"Appalling experience, A cafe called Earth who treated customers like aliens. We arrived at the cafe and just ordered juice and an americano. 40 minutes out, no service. asked the server why the delay. he reacted with arrogance 'it takes time the kitchen is busy'. for a glass of juice , the kitchen is busy!? on top of that when I was leaving disappointed , they charged me for the juice. did you not hear your customer complaining about it for 40 mins! Guys, Do yourself a favour and stay away from this place. They charge exorbitant prices for little to nothing on the plate and have the audacity to provide pathetic service."},"AmbianceScore":{"0":10,"1":10,"2":9,"3":8,"4":9,"5":8,"6":10,"7":10,"8":9,"9":10,"10":8,"11":9,"12":8,"13":8,"14":10,"15":8,"16":8,"17":10,"18":8,"19":10,"20":9,"21":10,"22":9,"23":8,"24":9,"25":10,"26":9,"27":10,"28":9,"29":10,"30":8,"31":8,"32":10,"33":9,"34":9,"35":10,"36":10,"37":9,"38":8,"39":10,"40":8,"41":10,"42":8,"43":9,"44":10,"45":10,"46":9,"47":9,"48":8,"49":10,"50":9,"51":10,"52":9,"53":8,"54":8,"55":10,"56":8,"57":10,"58":9,"59":9,"60":9,"61":10,"62":10,"63":8,"64":10,"65":9,"66":8,"67":8,"68":8,"69":8,"70":8,"71":9,"72":9,"73":10,"74":10,"75":9,"76":8,"77":9},"StaffScore":{"0":10,"1":9,"2":9,"3":10,"4":9,"5":9,"6":8,"7":8,"8":10,"9":10,"10":10,"11":9,"12":9,"13":10,"14":9,"15":8,"16":10,"17":9,"18":9,"19":8,"20":9,"21":8,"22":10,"23":8,"24":9,"25":10,"26":10,"27":10,"28":9,"29":9,"30":9,"31":9,"32":10,"33":8,"34":9,"35":9,"36":10,"37":8,"38":10,"39":10,"40":9,"41":10,"42":10,"43":8,"44":9,"45":9,"46":10,"47":9,"48":8,"49":8,"50":8,"51":9,"52":8,"53":8,"54":10,"55":10,"56":8,"57":9,"58":10,"59":10,"60":9,"61":9,"62":9,"63":8,"64":9,"65":8,"66":9,"67":9,"68":9,"69":9,"70":9,"71":9,"72":9,"73":10,"74":8,"75":9,"76":8,"77":10},"FoodScore":{"0":10,"1":9,"2":9,"3":9,"4":10,"5":8,"6":9,"7":8,"8":8,"9":9,"10":8,"11":10,"12":8,"13":9,"14":9,"15":8,"16":10,"17":9,"18":10,"19":10,"20":8,"21":9,"22":9,"23":8,"24":9,"25":9,"26":10,"27":10,"28":8,"29":9,"30":8,"31":8,"32":9,"33":8,"34":8,"35":9,"36":8,"37":8,"38":9,"39":8,"40":10,"41":9,"42":10,"43":9,"44":9,"45":10,"46":10,"47":8,"48":8,"49":8,"50":10,"51":8,"52":10,"53":10,"54":9,"55":8,"56":9,"57":8,"58":8,"59":10,"60":10,"61":10,"62":8,"63":9,"64":10,"65":8,"66":9,"67":9,"68":8,"69":8,"70":10,"71":9,"72":10,"73":9,"74":8,"75":8,"76":10,"77":10}}
