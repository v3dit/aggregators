I recently visited Chantilly and I tried their Strawberry Cream Cheese Sandwich and Hot Chocolates and let me tell you, it was a delightful experience. The sandwich was perfectly balanced with the sweet and tangy flavors of the strawberries and the creamy richness of the cream cheese. And the hot chocolates were absolutely heavenly, with a rich and velvety texture that warmed my soul. But what really stood out was the amazing ambience and hospitality at Chantilly. The cozy atmosphere and friendly staff made me feel right at home. If you're looking for a delicious treat with a side of great ambience and hospitality, Chantilly is the place to be!",

There were a few of the menu items on display which somehow left a lot lacking in the visual aspect. The waffles looked far from gigantic n doused with toppings. Anyways we placed an order for a cookie...quite large in size...decided against having it at the shop and took to warming it at home in the microwave to enjoy it at leisure. Now heres the glitch....it did melt but after a fair amount of time...and whilst that happened so did the cookie get all heated n oily...and that wasn't too pleasant. Sure it was loaded with chocolate chunks...white and dark but that was it...as a whole it lacked the depth of a cookie you can't seem to get enough of!!

So very sweet that I was just uncomfortable consuming it. u003cbr/>u003cbr/>On bringing this up with the manager, the first thing he said was that, this is a customer best seller and this is how it\u2019s served. He then said that it\u2019s my role as a customer to check with the waiter if sugar is added to the drink and how much of it is added.u003cbr/>u003cbr/>As a resolution, he offered to add a coffee shot to my coffee but to my surprise, the first thing he mentioned with this was the fact that I was going to be billed for it. Another sign of complete focus on billing rather than understanding a customer concern.u003cbr/>u003cbr/>All I got to hear was that the recipe is as is and that they can do nothing to help change the coffee. I was clearly told that no modifications can be made in the kitchen to alter the coffee as per my preferences and I had no choice but to either stick to the coffee or pay for an additional shot of coffee and milk and manually rectify this on my table.u003cbr/>u003cbr/>With no choice left, I agreed to pay the additional charges. A coffee shot and milk later, the coffee was still genuinely unpalatable.

    "545": "absolutely not worth the hype. after you wait 30 minutes for just a pick up order which could be streamlined you will get strictly average desserts. the hot chocolate was decent( overload of sugar) but the cookies were such a let down, overloaded sugar baked into a cookie with no texture at all. you won't taste anything but sugar leaving a bad after taste in your mouth. and I absolutely cannot agree with a few pieces of strawberry and melted chocolate being justified for 450/- bucks. ",
    "546": "Most overrated and overpriced thing i have ever had is their molten chocolate and strawberry..u003cbr/>Also the person taking the order ( must be the owner) was so busy that i had ordered for one take away and he punched the bill for 2! I couldn\u2019t fight back i regret this",
    "547": "leaked completely ",
    "548": "Very bad hot chocolate; half a cup/a cutting hot chocolate was delivered. Cheap personified by Chantilly",

    "551": "never ever order .. 350rs for this hardly 30ml of hot chocolate and after complaining no revert and disconnecting call . Never expect this from Chantily.. Pls stay away from ordering",
    "552": "So I recently visited Chantilly's with high spirits as I had heard a lot about their mouth watering desserts. When I reached, the thing that struck me was how small and cramped up the cafe is. Nevertheless, we waited for almost 30 minutes for a table thinking that it'll all be worth it. The tables are squashed together in such a way that you might as well share your breathing space with another person too! I felt it was even worse than being on a local train. u003cbr/>We ordered a Strawberry & Nutella Croissant as well as a Strawberry Cheesecake. Both the desserts were abysmal. The desserts were so small in size that it made me think that the food was meant for kids or pets for whom sugar is restricted. Next, the croissant itself was the most useless piece of pastry I have ever had the displeasure of eating. Kudos to the chef who prepared it and for Chantilly's to serve it at such an inflated rate. I am sure no one else has figured how to rip off customers like Chantilly's. The strawberry and Nutella that I have at my home tasted 100x better than what was served by them. The cheesecake was fine but again, the portion size was too small. u003cbr/>u003cbr/>I URGE everyone to never set foot in this cafe/dessert corner. You can try making the same thing at home with no experience and still come out with a dessert better than the one served to us.  I wish I could give a negative 5 star rating to this place. u003cbr/>",
    "553": "The guy handling the tables seems absolutely annoying. We were made to wait for easily half an hour outside and the guy was very rude and annoying. He took our names down but let many people get tables who came after us. On top of that, the food is extremely overpriced as well so wouldn\u2019t recommend it.",
    "554": "Worse worse worse and overhyped place. Not worth a penny. They served us tiny 10 pieces of strawberry with minimal chocolate sauce and charged us 450 rs which was not even worth 45 rs. Stand in a queue and get that shit served is a shame absolutely shameful.",
    "555": "Went here after all the hype, after waiting for nearly 2 hrs you get a place. I got a place of 2 for place of 4, somehow 4 had to adjust at a table of 2 that too outdoors. The cafe is tiny, they dont have space, the customers standing out on footpath (few even smoking) waiting for a table. After such a long wait, I asked for coffee, and they were out of cold coffees. Nearly 2/3rd of menu is not for vegeterians, and 1/3rd that is served is average. u003cbr/>I ordered a old fashioned strawberry chocolate cake, lotus biscoff, croissant with ice cream, hot chocolate, banana chocochip slice.u003cbr/>u003cbr/>old fashioned chocolate- It is average dessert that i have had at multiple other outlets, tastes nothinf new. Cafes like starbucks, poetry have similar lines. u003cbr/>u003cbr/>Lotus Biscoff cheesecake- Not great. And too sweet. u003cbr/>Teenagers visiting here should try Zinque Patisserie's cheesecake before they wait here for hrs. u003cbr/>u003cbr/>croissant with ice cream- Dont know what this was! Just not worth it.u003cbr/>u003cbr/>banana chocochip slice- pathetic! this was the worst dessert ever I have had. It somehow tasted stale (though the server claimed it was fresh and later didnt charge us for it), but this dessert is unforgivable.u003cbr/>u003cbr/>Hot chocolate- the only thing which was decent. But Grandmama's serves the same thing at lesser price. u003cbr/>u003cbr/>overall-u003cbr/>u003cbr/>Overhyped place by a bunch of teenagers who wait hrs to get in to taste something which is average.u003cbr/>This place is not worth 10 mins wait. switch to other outlets if one has to wait.u003cbr/>Very average desserts. I have had much better desserts at a sensible pricing. This place charges like a 3 star buffet to serve OKish dessrts.u003cbr/>I wish the way they display the rules on the board, they did display what is not available for the day, as a people wait here for hrs to get a table. It would not make sense to enter and not have what you want to drink/eat.u003cbr/>u003cbr/>u003cbr/>Skip it if asked to wait. Not worth the wait.",

However this time everything was sorely disappointing. We ordered the chocolate and strawberry tart and all of us found something really off about it. The tart shell was stale and there was a really bad after taste. Since It was something I had ordered previously I knew it wasn\u2019t tasting right. We complained and they took it to for the chef to try, only to return and say he tried the tart and everything was perfectly how it was supposed to be and kept the SAME tart back on the table. Not only was the tart stale but the chef had also eaten from it and they thought it was perfectly acceptable to put it back on the table.",
    "560": "I waited almost an hour and they I went nearby because there was someone smoking near me. I came back in 5 mins and he says that they called out my name and I was not there.

The servers could barely make any recommendations when asked for a cake that was dark chocolate based, would be slightly on the bitter side and fudgy texture-wise. So much for being a dessert place! They didn't have any coffees at 3:30 pm on a weekday. Some would argue for the aesthetic; but given how tiny the cafe is, the whole thing is rather underwhelming!",

We sat on the stairs as per his suggestion which he was very rude about again for exactly the amount of time needed and we weren\u2019t surprised to see the table was not occupied or needed.
